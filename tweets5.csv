"Combined with new demands &amp; Israeli existing positions that disconnect the Holy Sites file condition reconstruction on an unlikely prisoner release. The countdown to public questioning in Gaza of Hamas gains from Al Quds Sword campaign now begins, now that the parades have ended."
"Even on the reconstruction file, talks are stalled. Unlike last rounds, Hamas' base negotiating position is to manage the process, against regional consensus that the Ramallah Authority (which recently canceled elections to stifle Hamas) oversee the process with Egypt."
"Perhaps trumping reconstruction is the prisoner file, which is of top importance to Palestinians. Sinwar's demand of '1,111' prisoners  has now brought unreasonable expectations into the their minds, as the Israelis will not agree to a repeat of the Waha al-Ahrar exchange of 2011"
